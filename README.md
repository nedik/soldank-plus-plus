## Requirements
The project is written in C++23 and depends on:
- [OpenGL 2.1+](https://www.opengl.org/)
- [CPM.cmake](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake)
- [glad](https://glad.dav1d.de/)
- [glfw-3.3.8+](https://www.glfw.org/)
- [glm](https://github.com/g-truc/glm)
- [stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb)
- [FreeType](https://freetype.org/)
- [gtest 1.13.0+](https://github.com/google/googletest)
- [GameNetworkingSockets](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/GameNetworkingSockets)
- [daScript 0.4](https://dascript.org/)
- [cxxopts](https://github.com/jarro2783/cxxopts)

## Building
Recommended to build using [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) to prepare
the package [GameNetworkingSockets](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/GameNetworkingSockets)
which unfortunately can't be prepared using [CPM.cmake](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake)

### Windows
In project root directory run:
```
> git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg
> .\vcpkg\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
```

Make sure you have CMake installed. The project uses [CPM.cmake](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake) to download required packages.
To install all the required package using:
```
> mkdir build
> cd build
> cmake ..
```
You should now be able to build executables using `make` on linux or to open generated solution in visual studio on windows
